This phone is amazing. I upgraded from the Galaxy S10+ because, well it was time. The camera is amazing and so are all the features of the phone. It connects to everything I've needed it for seamlessly and quickly. It will take me a while to navigate all the things I can do but so far I'm very pleased. Read full review...
